### Hi there, I'm Meng Shen aka Jeremy 👋

Stuck at the crossroads of deciding which path to pursue as a software engineer. Still undecided between frontend, backend or weekend 😄

- 📚 I’m currently a Year 4 Computer Engineering undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS).
- 💻 I did a 6-month internship as a full stack software engineer at Lumitics.
- 💻 I did a 3-month internship as a backend software engineer at Saleswhale.
- ✍ I like to write. I usually write about programming and productivity. I also make an occasional attempt at poetry.
