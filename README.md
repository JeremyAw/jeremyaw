I focus on building great products with intuitive user experiences. I believe in product-centric engineering to solve real business problems, not write code blindly.

From code to coffee breaks, I'm always up for a good conversation. Whether you want to brainstorm, talk tech or swap work-life hacks, my inbox is open.
