### Hi there, I'm Meng Shen aka Jeremy 👋

Programming provides me with an avenue to build things and express my creativity. There is no joy without woe and in here, you find them inextricably intertwined, perfectly balanced as all things should be. On one hand, I find it fun to put the different pieces together, tinkering with the product in a coherent and logical manner. On the other hand, there is nothing but agony in the pursuit of bugs that require removal with surgical precision. While the intellectual stimulation can be rewarding, bug fixing remains an anathema to me. Nevertheless, I press on in my programming endeavors.

TLDR: I like to code.

- 📚 I’m currently a Year 4 Computer Engineering undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS).
- 💻 I did a 6-month internship as a full stack software engineer at Lumitics.
- 💻 I did a 3-month internship as a backend software engineer at Saleswhale.

- ✍ I like to write. 
I usually write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jeremyinelysium) about programming and productivity. I also make an occasional attempt at poetry.
